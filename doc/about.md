## What is monopoly

Monopoly is a game that most of us have probably experienced at least once in our childhood. Unfortunately, one of the significant challenges we often face is the frequent loss of the game's currency notes.

As a solution to this problem, it was common for us to turn to toy stores, where we could purchase new money notes to compensate for the original ones that were missing.

Over the years, the Monopoly Super Electronic Banking emerged as an enhanced version of the game. Instead of paper money, it utilized cards along with a small device that replaced the traditional paper notes, adding a more technological aspect to the play. Unfortunately, card reading sometimes failed, resulting in issues such as misinterpretation of card numbers.

To address this matter, I am developing this project to serve as a backend for the banker, facilitating the management of all players during the game.
